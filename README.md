# tcpasync
A Java framework to work with length prefixed (2I/2E etc) TCP messages. The goal is to build on top of this and
provide a load testing tool for raw TCP custom protocols. 

* Check Test `TcpClientTest.testClient` for sample usage
* For a typical use case see this - http://raghablog.blogspot.com/2015/04/tcpasync-load-testing-tcp-messages.html
